# Le nouveau Coin

This project was made to make Le Bon Coin more modern. I used this UI/UX design by Nicolas Bouffier: https://www.behance.net/gallery/104327815/UI-UX-Leboncoin?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cleboncoin

You can use the project on its deployed version here: 

## Functionnalities

In the project, because it's only a frontend version with no API, you can only add some articles to your favorite items.
Of course, this project is still in developpment to add new features.

### How it's made

I used mostly React.js to make this project. I tried to make it all without packages.
